# Justice for Daunte Wright
A father, son, and boyfriend. **Daunte Wright** was innocent and unarmed man, and yet, was murdered by a fatal gunshot wound executed by an officer from the Minneapolis Police Department. It occured on _April 11, 2021_, when Daunte was pulled over due to traffic violation and the officers soon realized Daunte had an exsisting warrant, and continued to hand cuff him. While doing so, Daunte tried to re-enter his vehicle and soon after was fatally shot and died a few miles away from the scene.

> "It is my belief that the officer had the intention to deploy their Taser but instead shot Mr. Wright with a single bullet", as Brooklyn Center Police Cheif Tim Gannon said at a news conference.
